Environment for the game Blokus

Requirements

How to Play
The game is played on a 20x20 grid. The objective is to place all of your tiles on the board while blocking your opponent from doing the same.

Each player starts with 21 tiles of a different color. The tiles must be placed touching only corners, not sides.

Pick someone to go first. Play continues clockwise with each player placing one of their tiles on the board per turn.

If a player is unable to place any tiles on their turn, they have lost the game. The player with the most tiles placed on the board at the end of the game wins.

Controls
